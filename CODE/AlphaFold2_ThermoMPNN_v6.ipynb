single-site mutagenesis (SSM), y axis allows you to see the predicted effects of mutating the wild-type amino acid at a specific position to each of the other possible amino acids. For instance, if you're looking at the row for 'A' (Alanine), you're looking at the predicted stability changes (ddG values) for mutations where the original amino acid at each position is changed to Alanine.\n","\n","The color intensity in each cell of the heatmap shows the magnitude of the effect on protein stability for that particular mutation, with the scale provided by the color bar on the right. Cool colors (e.g., blue) typically indicate stabilizing mutations that increase protein stability (negative ddG), while warm colors (e.g., red) indicate destabilizing mutations that decrease stability (positive ddG).\n","\n","\n","different PDB files representing different proteins or different mutants of the same protein will result in different thermostability profiles, as reflected in such a heatmap.\n","\n","Here’s how to interpret this type of heatmap:\n","\n","Amino Acid Rows (Y-axis): Each row corresponds to one of the 20 standard amino acids (plus any special characters, like stop codons or gaps, if included). This is the potential amino acid to which the native residue can be mutated.\n","\n","Position Columns (X-axis): Each column represents a position in the protein sequence where mutations are considered. These are specific spots in the protein's structure where amino acid changes might affect the protein's function or stability.\n","\n","Color Coding: The colors indicate the predicted change in protein stability (ΔΔG) upon mutation:\n","\n","Red: A higher ΔΔG value, indicating that the mutation is predicted to decrease protein stability (destabilizing mutation).\n","\n","Blue: A lower (negative) ΔΔG value, suggesting that the mutation could increase stability (stabilizing mutation).\n","\n","White or Pale Colors: ΔΔG values close to zero, indicating little to no effect on stability.\n","\n","Interpreting Patterns:\n","\n","Dark Red Squares: If you see a position with many dark red squares (e.g., many different amino acid changes all result in high positive ΔΔG), this suggests that the native residue is important for stability and that it is sensitive to substitution.\n","\n","Dark Blue Squares: Conversely, if you see dark blue squares, these are potential stabilizing mutations. However, these should be interpreted with caution, as some might be structurally or functionally disruptive despite being 'stabilizing' in terms of energy.\n","\n","Rows or Columns with Varying Colors: Variation in a row suggests that the specific amino acid replacement varies in its effect depending on where it occurs in the protein. Variation across a column suggests that the specific position has different sensitivities to various amino acid replacements.\n","Biological Context: To fully interpret the heatmap, you should consider the biological context of the mutations. For instance, mutations in active sites, binding interfaces, or structurally critical regions may have functional consequences that aren't directly related to the simplistic measure of thermodynamic stability.\n","\n","When you switch to a different PDB file, the protein sequence—hence, the specific positions—and possibly the folding and stability landscape will change. Therefore, the heatmap for another PDB file will reflect the mutational effects pertinent to that new structure's specific amino acid sequence and 3D conformation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hR2cfOutfMxO"},"source":["Key Features of Annexin V (1APS):\n","\n","Biological Role: Annexin V is involved in the anticoagulant protein complex and plays a role in the inhibition of blood coagulation by competing for phospholipid binding sites with procoagulant proteins.
